This is a backup copy. The majority difference between this one and the previous version is that 
in this version, the input dictionary is different from the output dictionary. In this case, 
it's a little bit complicated to coordinate the input and output data flow.

However, this project is still under development. It's hard to say which way is better. Therefore,
I would like to keep this version and perhaps in the future, I might need this one.

    """
    This function carries out the iterative projection for one iteration.

    This function aims to be a stablized version of the previous function. According to Professor
    Russell Luke in the paper

        Relaxed averaged alternating reflections for diffraction imaging.

    It seems that the way one impose the magnitude constrain also introduces some instablity.
    Therefore, he has proposed to used an approximation to the magnitude constrain opeartor. This
    function implements that idea.

    In this function, the magnitude operator is not implemented in the naive way. Rather, if one
    would like to know the detail, then he should either look that the paper and find the formula
    (34) or look at the function : approximate_magnitude_projection   in this script.

    However one should notice that, that approximation is not directly available in real world
    applications. The reason is complicated.

    The most important reason is that in that formula, Prof. Luke seems to have assumed that
    there is not gaps on the detectors. However, there are a lot of gaps on the detector. Therefore
    there will be a lot of edges in the magnitude array if one set the unknown pixels to be zero.
    However, these artificial edges will have huge influences on inverse fourier transformations.

    Therefore, I have added the following operations.
    1. Get the magnitude of the diffraction patterns derived from the input density operators.
    2. Replace the corresponding values in this pattern with the experiment values.
    3. Use the modified array to do the magnitude projection.
